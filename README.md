# Gradient Descent with Linear Regression and Stocks

My first machine learning project that uses gradient descent to find values for the linear regression equation of a Bank of America's stock price over 6 months. From February 2nd to August 3rd 2017.

This was a proof of concept and was not intended to accurately represent Bank of America's stock price. All stock price values were subtracted by the value '22' in the excel table to make the learning less time consuming. To run this linear regression program on any stock, replace the values in column 3 of the excel table with appropriate 6 month values. Values can be found on NASDAQ historical prices after entering the stock ticker.
